Here are **websites and services that let you host your HTML website for free** — great for portfolios, personal pages, demos, or simple static sites (HTML/CSS/JS):

### 🆓 Simple Upload-and-Go Hosts

These allow you to upload your files (often drag-and-drop or ZIP) and get a live URL quickly — perfect if you don’t want to deal with Git or version control:

* **LinkyHost** – Upload your HTML/CSS/JS (or ZIP) and go live with a free subdomain and SSL. ([LinkyHost][1])
* **HostMyHTML** – Free static HTML hosting with easy drag-and-drop upload. ([HostMyHTML][2])
* **Static.run** – Upload your static site and get instant hosting, custom domains supported. ([Static.run][3])
* **gohosted.app** – Free static hosting with SSL, analytics, and live links. ([GoHosted][4])
* **Pagelet.host** – Very simple HTML upload with an instant live URL. ([pagelet.host][5])
* **Static.app** – Drag-and-drop HTML hosting with built-in file manager. ([Static.app][6])
* **Bopbee** – Instant static site deployment by dragging and dropping files. ([bopbee][7])
* **FreeHostHtml** – Paste your HTML code and get a live link instantly. ([FreeHostHtml][8])

### 🌐 Classic & Developer-Friendly Static Hosts

These are popular with developers and offer more control (some may require Git or CLI deployment):

* **Neocities** – Free hosting with storage and bandwidth for static pages (revival of GeoCities style). ([Wikipedia][9])
* **GitHub Pages** – Host static sites from a GitHub repo (free HTTPS). (Suggested by many devs) ([Reddit][10])
* **Cloudflare Pages** – Free static hosting with global CDN (good for faster load times). (Common recommendation) ([Reddit][11])
* **Netlify** – Free tier for static sites with drag-and-drop deploy or Git integration. (Often suggested) ([Reddit][10])
* **Vercel** – Free static site hosting with neat deployment from Git. (Also recommended by webdev communities) ([Reddit][12])

### 📌 Notes & Tips

* These hosts are best for **static sites** — pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc., no server-side code like PHP. ([Reddit][10])
* Some (e.g., GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages) *deploy via Git*, not just manual upload. ([Reddit][11])
* Most give you a **free subdomain**, but you can usually connect a **custom domain** if you own one. ([LinkyHost][1])

If you want, I can help you **choose the best one based on your needs** (e.g., easiest upload, custom domain, no Git required).

Notes: Web dev projects have a pretty predictable meeting “arc.” Here’s the usual flow from day zero to launch (and after), with what each meeting is actually for in real life—not just the calendar label.

_____________Beginning of Pre-Code Meetings_____________________

1. Discovery / Intro Call

When: Before anything is scoped or quoted
Who: Client, PM, sometimes tech lead
Purpose:

Understand the problem (not the solution yet)

Business goals, users, constraints

Budget range, timeline expectations

Red flags on both sides 😅

Typical outputs:

High-level requirements

Go / no-go decision

Next steps (proposal or workshop)

2. Requirements / Discovery Workshop

When: Early, after intro call
Who: Client stakeholders, PM, UX, tech lead
Purpose:

Dig into features, workflows, edge cases

Define user personas & journeys

Clarify integrations, data, permissions

Typical outputs:

Functional requirements

Feature list or backlog

Early assumptions and risks

3. Technical Scoping / Architecture Meeting

When: After requirements start to solidify
Who: Developers, tech lead, sometimes PM
Purpose:

Choose stack, frameworks, hosting

Discuss performance, security, scalability

Identify technical risks & tradeoffs

Typical outputs:

Architecture diagram

Tech stack decisions

Here are **good examples and inspirations for cybersecurity professional portfolio websites** — including *real portfolios*, *project repositories*, and *design examples/templates you can base your own site on*:

---

## 🔐 Real Portfolio Examples (See How Others Showcase Work)

### **1. GitHub-Hosted Cybersecurity Portfolios**

These aren’t full live websites but are *excellent real examples of how professionals structure their portfolios, projects, and documentation — ideal for embedding into a static site or GitHub Pages.*

* **Cybersecurity Projects + Skills Showcase** – Rebecca’s portfolio has sections for projects, tools used, experience, and contact links. ([GitHub][1])
  **Platform:** GitHub
  **Good for:** Project summaries, tool lists, technical documentation

* **Threat Detection & Cloud Security Portfolio** – Includes hands-on labs, automation scripts, network defense, IAM, and incident response work. ([GitHub][2])
  **Platform:** GitHub
  **Good for:** Detailed labs and skill demonstration

* **Security Write-ups, Tools & Notes Collection** – A mix of personal projects, CTF write-ups, and tools that show learning progression. ([GitHub][3])
  **Platform:** GitHub
  **Good for:** Beginners starting their portfolio with notes & practical work

* **Comprehensive Mock Client Projects** – A portfolio featuring audits, incident response, IDS/SIEM work, and more advanced tasks. ([GitHub][4])
  **Platform:** GitHub
  **Good for:** End-to-end demonstration of security workflows

## 💻 Live/Hosted Portfolio Websites

### **2. Personal Portfolio Websites**

These examples show *how real professionals structure live portfolio sites* — useful for inspiration on layout, narrative, and content organization.

* **JP’s Cybersecurity Portfolio** — A personal site with *about, philosophy, and connected narrative* that makes technical experience relatable. ([Jp's Portfolio][5])
  **Good for:** Personal branding + storytelling

* **“Ramblings of a CyberSecurity Nerd”** — A deep portfolio that doubles as a *technical blog + work journal*, documenting real defensive skills like SOC workflows and DFIR. ([Ramblings of a CyberSecurity Nerd][6])
  **Good for:** Combining portfolio + educational content

⚠️ *Note:* Because many cybersecurity professionals host their portfolios on personal domains or GitHub Pages, **you may not always find large lists of live public portfolios indexed online**, but reviewing active GitHub repos and personal sites above gives a good template for structure.

## 🧠 Portfolio Design Templates & UI Inspiration

If you’re **building your own website from scratch**, these templates help with layout, visuals, and presentation:

### **3. Pre-Made Portfolio Templates**

These aren’t finished live sites but *professional templates* you can use or adapt for your portfolio:

* **Cyber Security Experts Portfolio Template (CSUME)** – A sleeker one-page layout designed specifically for showcasing cybersecurity skills, certifications, project sections, contact, etc. ([Dribbble][7])
  **Good for:** Clean, modern visual presentation

* **Next.js Cyber Security Portfolio Template (Csume v2)** – A slightly more dynamic template built with Next.js, responsive and SEO friendly. ([TemplateMonster][8])
  **Good for:** More advanced static site generation

## 📌 Tips for a Great Cybersecurity Portfolio Website
